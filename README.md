    php artisan migrate
    ```

3. **Seed the Database (Optional)**

    If you have seeders, populate your database with:

    ```bash
    php artisan db:seed

## Database Migration

Migrations are located in the `database/migrations` directory. Ensure that your database schema is up-to-date by running the migrations.

## Usage

1. **Start the Development Server**

    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```
